   :local:

Users are responsible for informing beamline staff of any chemical waste created in their experiment and for properly handling such waste.  Chemical waste should never be disposed of in laboratory sinks, drains, or trash cans.  Please properly contain your waste, clearly label it with your name, the contents, and the date when the waste began to be stored in the container.  Please fill out a chemical waste log, found `here <Waste_Form_Blank.pdf>`.  E-mail an electronic copy to your beamline contact and tape a paper copy to your waste container.  Unless informed otherwise by beamline staff, store your waste containers in the waste cabinet in the wet lab.
