PIN Diodes
-----------------

The beamline is equipped with several PIN diodes for measuring beam intensity.  These PIN diodes are silicon Hamamatsu x-ray photodiodes in a brass casing designed by the APS Detector Pool.  The diodes are covered with electrically-conductive Kapton film to seal out ambient light.  There are three diodes with 10 x 10 mm active area (S3590-09, 300 micron thick) and one diode with 28 x 28 mm active area (S3584-09, 300 microns thick).  

Fluorescence Detectors
------------------------

The beamline is equipped with a Vortex EX-60 silicon drift diode detector for fluorescence measurements.  The detector has an active area of 80 mm\ :sup:`2`.  A Canberra germanium detector is also available for high-energy fluorescence.  For both of these detectors, readout is performed with an XIA Mercury DXP.
