The beamline is equipped with several closed-circuit cameras to allow experiments to be viewed remotely.  Three of these cameras in 7-BM-B are pan-tilt-zoom for flexibility in viewing experiments.  All video signals are directed to the video multiplexer below the TV monitor at the user station.  One of the cameras in 7-BM-B is equipped with a microphone, which is directly connected to the monitor to allow users to hear sound in the hutch.

To operate the multiplexer, simply push the numbered button corresponding to the camera you wish to view.

To use one of the open multiplexer channels, use the BNC patch panels to patch the video output back to the user station, then plug the signal into the back of the multiplexer. 

To operate the pan-tilt-zoom cameras, use the joystick control next to the multiplexer.  Press the button in the upper part of the panel to select the camera, then use the joystick to pan, tilt, and (by twisting the joystick) zoom.
