X-ray Optics
=============

7-BM features a series of x-ray optics to manipulate the x-ray beam.

Filters
--------

A water-cooled filter set is located in 7-BM-A.  This is mostly used to prefilter the beam for tomography and high-speed imaging experiments, though it can also be used to filter low energy x-rays when using the single-bounce multilayer mirror (described below).  The control for the filters is found in the 7-BM-A control screen.  There are two filter units, so up to two filters can be used simultaneously.

It takes several seconds to move between filter materials.  Please remember to close the 7-BM-A shutter before moving the filters.

Double Multilayer Monochromator
---------------------------------

For monochromatic beam experiments at 6-16 keV, a double multilayer monochromator is used.  The monochromator has two polished Si substrates, each 60 mm wide x 120 mm long.  The substrates were coated with three stripes by Rigaku.  One stripe is at 2.0 nm nominal d-spacing.  The second is at 3.5 nm nominal d-spacing.  The middle stripe is split: the bottom half of the beam is reflected from a 2.0 nm coating, the top half from a 3.5 nm coating.  This is useful for dual-energy experiments.  Each stripe is ~ 8 mm wide.

7-BM-B Multilayer Mirror
-------------------------------

For more flexibiity in energy range, a multilayer mirror can be placed in 7-BM-B.  This mirror has two coatings, at 2.1 nm and 4.0 nm nominal d-spacing, respectively.  The mirror uses a 200 mm long Si substrate.  This mirror is operated with the beamline in white beam mode, and requires cooling water from the hutch DI water system.

Focusing Mirrors
----------------

For focused-beam experiments with the monochromatic beam, the beamline has a pair of IDT Kirkpatrick-Baez focusing mirrors.  The mirrors are silicon, each 300 mm long, with a 260 mm optical length.  The mirrors can be dynamically bent to change the focal position.  Typical operation of the mirrors is a 5 mrad grazing angle at 8 keV, 3-3.5 mrad at 15 keV.  The mirrors are Rh coated.  To use these mirrors, remember that a helium purge must be established first.

Polycapillary Optics
--------------------

The beamline is equipped with two polycapillary optics from XOS.  The first optic has a 100 mm focal length and is optimized for lower photon energies.  The second is 50 mm focal length and works well at I :math:r`'K_{\alpha}` (28.6 keV).  Both optics are uncoated glass.  These optics are mostly used for confocal fluorescence microscopy.
