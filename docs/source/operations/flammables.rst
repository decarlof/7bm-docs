Flammable gas cabinet
=======

Flammable gas cylinders should be kept in the ventilated cabinet near the control rack.  This cabinet is equipped with a dedicated flow line that terminates in a ball valve on the outboard wall of 7-BM-B.  Note: this line is 1/8" OD, and as such does not support high volume flow.
