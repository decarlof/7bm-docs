Visible Light Optics
=============

7-BM posesses visible light optics and cameras for both standard visible imaging and for use with scintillator crystals for indirect x-ray imaging.

Lens systems include:

  + Infinity Photo-Optical K2 long-distance microscope, with CF-2, CF-3, or CF-4 objective.
  + Mitutoyo M Plan Apo long distance microscope objectives.  The beamline has 2x, 5x, and 10x objectives on-hand.
  + Nikon macro camera lenses, from 50 mm to 105 mm focal length.  A unique application is the use of two camera lenses (50 mm and 105 mm) coupled on their object sides.  This allows for a large amount of light capture at ~ 2x magnification at short working distance.
  + Several C-mount lenses for closed-circuit cameras, from 10-50 mm focal length.

Beamline staff also have access to a Thorlabs `DC2200 <https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=DC2200>`_ LED driver for high-intensity LEDs.
