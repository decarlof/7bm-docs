The beamline is equipped with two Synaccess NP-02 remotely controllable outlets.  These units allow two AC power outlets to be switched remotely and independently through a web interface.  One is used on the roof of 7-BM-B to control power to the tomography rotation stage servo driver.  The other is available for users in 7-BM-B.
