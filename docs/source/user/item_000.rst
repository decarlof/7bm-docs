Beamline Control
================

All beamline components and detectors are controlled using `EPICS <https://epics-controls.org/>`_ and `areaDetector <https://areadetector.github.io/master/index.html>`_.
Each device can be configure and controlled through a graphic user interface (GUI) or through a python script using `PyEpics <https://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/python/pyepics3/>`_.

To start the tomography control user interface::

    [user2bmb@arcturus,42,~]$ start_tomo
