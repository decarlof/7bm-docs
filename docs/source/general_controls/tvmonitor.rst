TV Monitor
==========

.. contents:: 
   :local:

The beamline is equipped with several closed-circuit cameras to allow experiments to be viewed remotely.  All video signals are directed to the video multiplexer below the TV monitor at the user station.  To operate the multiplexer, simply push the numbered button corresponding to the camera you wish to view.

+ Three of these cameras in 7-BM-B are pan-tilt-zoom with a joystick control near the TV monitor for flexibility in viewing experiments.  To operate the pan-tilt-zoom cameras, use the joystick control next to the multiplexer.  Press the button in the upper part of the panel to select the camera, then use the joystick to pan, tilt, and (by twisting the joystick) zoom.
+ Three of the cameras in 7-BM-B are pan-tilt-zoom controlled via a web interface.
+ One of the cameras in 7-BM-B is equipped with a microphone, which is directly connected to the monitor to allow users to hear sound in the hutch.
+ Four of the cameras (#1, 2, 3, and 7 below) can be viewed (but not controlled) through a `web interface <https://s7bmb4vid.xray.aps.anl.gov>`_.

To use one of the open multiplexer channels, use the BNC patch panels to patch the video output back to the user station, then plug the signal into the back of the multiplexer.
